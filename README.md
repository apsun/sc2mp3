# SoundCloud to MP3

Yet another SoundCloud downloader.

- Uses native download option if available
- Download in HQ with a SoundCloud Go+ subscription

## How do I download in HQ?

You need to be a SoundCloud Go+ subscriber for this feature to work.
Open the addon preferences and enable the "Download in High Quality"
setting. As long as you stay logged in, your downloads will use the
high quality setting (256kbps AAC). If you log out, downloads will
automatically revert to 128kbps MP3.

Note that enabling this setting will cause your login identity to be
sent to SoundCloud in order to access the high quality tracks. If you
wish to avoid risking a banhammer on your SoundCloud account (depending
on your interpretation, downloading tracks may be a violation of the
ToS), do not enable this feature.
